# Stay on Track

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a deployable web application that will help you stay on track. Our lives are filled with constant stimulation and many times it becomes difficult to stay on top of our weekly objectives. With the stay on track web agenda you can map out your life week by week, offering the user all kinds of productivity enhancing features like color coordination and prioritization. This site offers local storage options so you can access your agenda whenever you'd like.
