# Stay on Track

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a deployable web application that will help you stay on track. Our lives are filled with constant stimulation and many times it becomes difficult to stay on top of our daily objectives. With the stay on track web agenda you can map out your life day by day, offering the user all kinds of productivity enhancing features, such as color coordination and time management. This site offers also local storage options so you can access your agenda whenever you'd like.
